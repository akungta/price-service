}

Assumptions
---
1. As there are multiple providers of the data, we have a unique identifier for each batch session.
2. The payload data structure is mapped to instrument id, i.e. for a given instrument id like "stocks", the payload data structure will always be same.
3. The new instrument and it's payload data structure needs to programmatically configured before it can consumed by the service.
